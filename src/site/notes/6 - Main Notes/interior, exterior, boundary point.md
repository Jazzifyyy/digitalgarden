### Definition

Suppose $(X,\mathcal{O})$ is a [[6 - Main Notes/topological space\|topological space]] and suppose $B \subseteq X$. 

A point $x \in X$ is called:
1. an **interior point** of $B$ if $B$ is a neighborhood of $x$.
2. an **exterior point** of $B$ if $X \setminus B$ is a neighborhood of $x$.
3. a **boundary point** of $B$ if neither $B$, nor $X \setminus B$ is a neighborhood of $x$.
