### Definition

A [[6 - Main Notes/Statistic (inference fall)\|statistic]] $T(\mathbf{X})$ is said to be a **minimal sufficient statistic** for $\theta$ iff the following conditions hold:
1. $T(\mathbf{X})$ is [[6 - Main Notes/sufficient statistic\|sufficient]] for $\theta$.
2. If $S(\mathbf{X})$ is some other sufficient statistic for $\theta$, then there exists some function $g$ such that $T(\mathbf{x})=g[S(\mathbf{x})]$ for all $x \in \mathcal{X}$.
