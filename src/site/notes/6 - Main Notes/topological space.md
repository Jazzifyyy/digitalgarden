### Definition

A **topological space** $(X, \mathcal{O})$ consisting of a set $X$ and a set $\mathcal{O}$ of subsets of $X$ (called *open sets*) such that the following axioms hold:
1. We have $\emptyset,X \in \mathcal{O}$, i.e., $\emptyset$ and $X$ are open.
2. Any arbitrary union of members of $\mathcal{O}$ belongs to $\mathcal{O}$, i.e., any union of open sets is open.
3. The intersection of any two members of $\mathcal{O}$ belongs to $\mathcal{O}$, i.e., the intersection of any two open sets is open.

Usually, one drops the topology from the notation and speaks simply of the topological space $X$.

### Example

##### Ex. 1

Given $X= \{ 1,2,3,4 \}$, the *trivial* topology on $X$ is the collection $\mathcal{O} = \{ \{  \}, \{ 1,2,3,4 \} \}$.
