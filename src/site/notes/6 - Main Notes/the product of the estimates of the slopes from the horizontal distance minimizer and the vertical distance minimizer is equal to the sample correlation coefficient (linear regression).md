(See: [[6 - Main Notes/estimates of linear regression parameters by minimizing the sum of squares of vertical distances\|estimates of linear regression parameters by minimizing the sum of squares of vertical distances]], [[6 - Main Notes/estimates of linear regression parameters by minimizing the sum of squares of horizontal distances\|estimates of linear regression parameters by minimizing the sum of squares of horizontal distances]])
### Statement

We have
$$\hat{\beta}_{1} \hat{\alpha}_{1}= r^2$$

where $r$ is the [[6 - Main Notes/Sample Pearson Correlation Coefficient\|sample correlation coefficient]].
