### Definition

Suppose $T:V \rightarrow V$ is a linear map and $A$ is the associated matrix.

We call $\mathbf{v}_{1},\dots,\mathbf{v}_{n}$ an **eigenbasis** of $A$ iff $\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},\dots,\mathbf{v}_{n} \}$ forms a basis of $V$ and are the [[6 - Main Notes/eigenvector and eigenvalue\|eigenvectors]] of $A$.
