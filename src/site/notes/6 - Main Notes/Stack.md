An ordered list of elements of any type.
#### Operations
1. `create(S)`: Creates a new empty stack.
2. `isEmpty(S)`: Checks if the stack is empty.
3. `isFull(S)`: Checks if the stack is full.
4. `push(S,x)`: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
5. `pop(S)`: Removes an element from the top of the stack. 
6. `peek(S)`: Returns the top most element of the queue.
