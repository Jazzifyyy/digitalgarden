### Statement

A real square matrix is an [[6 - Main Notes/orthogonally diagonalizable matrix\|orthogonally diagonalizable matrix]] iff it is symmetric.

### Proof

Suppose $A$ is orthogonally diagonalisable, then there exists a diagonal matrix $D$ and an orthogonal matix $S$ such that $D=S^TAS$, which implies that $A^T=(SDS^T)^T=SDS^T=A$ and therefore, $A$ is symmetric.
