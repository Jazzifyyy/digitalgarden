### Definition

A pmf/pdf $f_{\theta}(\cdot)$ belongs to the **one-parameter exponential family** iff
$$f_{\theta}(x)=c(x).\exp \{ a(\theta) \tau(x)-b(\theta)) \}$$
for all $x \in S$, where $S$ is the support of the distribution, and for all $\theta \in \Theta$.

### Note
+ The support $S$ must not involve the parameter $\theta$.
