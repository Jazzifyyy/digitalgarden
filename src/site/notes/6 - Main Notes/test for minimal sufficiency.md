### Statement

Suppose $p_{\theta}(\cdot)$ is a joint pdf/pmf. 

If a [[6 - Main Notes/Statistic (inference fall)\|statistic]] $T(\cdot)$ has the following property:

$$\frac{p_{\theta}(\mathbf{x})}{p_{\theta}(\mathbf{y})} \text{ is free of }\theta \text{ iff }T(\mathbf{x})=T(\mathbf{y});$$
then $T(\cdot)$ is a [[6 - Main Notes/minimal sufficient statistic\|minimal sufficient statistic]] for $\theta$.
