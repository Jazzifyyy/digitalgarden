### Definition
A triple $(V,+,\cdot)$ consisting of a set $V$, a map $+:V \times V \rightarrow V$ called addition such that $$(x,y) \mapsto x+y$$
and another map $\cdot:\mathbb{F} \times V \rightarrow V$ called scalar multiplication such that
$$(\lambda,x) \mapsto \lambda x$$
is called a **vector space over $\mathbb{F}$** if the following eight axioms hold for the maps $\cdot$ and $+$: [[6 - Main Notes/Axioms For a Set to be a Vector Space\|Axioms For a Set to be a Vector Space]].
