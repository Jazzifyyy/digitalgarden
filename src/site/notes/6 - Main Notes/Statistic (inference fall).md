### Definition

A statistic $T(\mathbf{X})$ is a measurable function of the sample. A statistic is computed using the sample and the sample only.

A function is measurable if we can assign probabilities to it. In particular, $\mathbb{P}_{\theta}\{ T(\mathbf{X}) \in O \}$ is defined for any open set $O$.

Also, $\mathbb{P}_{\theta}\{ T(\mathbf{X}) \in (-\infty,t] \} = \mathbb{P}_{\theta}\{ T(\mathbf{X}) \leq t \}$ is well defined.

+ Ideally, the summary statistic should be chosen in a way such that no information about $\theta$ is lost in the process. See: [[6 - Main Notes/sufficient statistic\|sufficient statistic]].
