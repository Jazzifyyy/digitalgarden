### Problem

Consider two random variables $(X,Y)$ distributed as bivariate normal. Based on a random sample from this bivariate distribution, the fitted least square regression line of $Y$ on $X$ and that of $X$ on $Y$ were
$$Y=-3X + 22\text{ and }X=-0.12Y+5.84.$$
Find the sample means of $X$ and $Y$, the sample correlation between $X$ and $Y$, and the ratio of the sample variance of $X$ and $Y$.
