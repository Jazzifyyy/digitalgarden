### Form 1

The linear regression line formed after minimizing the sum of squares of the vertical distances of the data points from the line is given by
$$\frac{y- \bar{y}}{\sqrt{ \text{Var}(y) }}= r(x,y) \frac{x- \bar{x}}{\sqrt{ \text{Var}(x) }}$$
where $\text{Var}(x)$ and $\text{Var}(x)$ are the sample variances and $r(x,y)$ is the [[6 - Main Notes/Sample Pearson Correlation Coefficient\|sample correlation coefficient]].
